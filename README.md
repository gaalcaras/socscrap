# Soscrap

Teaching webscraping to social scientists!

The package provides:

+ A fully working Allocin√© webscraper (try `get_ratings`!), with a range of
  high-level functions (extracting a year of data) to lower-level functions
  (extracting text with XPath query or CSS selector)
+ Extensive documentation (vignettes in French, `?get_ratings`)
+ Data generated by the scraper (try `data(ratings)`)
+ Slides presenting the basics of webscraping (go to `inst/slides`) to learn
  more

## Installing socscrap

`socscrap` is not available on CRAN at the moment, and must be installed
directly from Github using the `devtools` package.

Some Windows users might need to [install Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
to compile the package.

```r
# If you don't have devtools installed already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install socscrap package
devtools::install_github("gaalcaras/socscrap")
```
